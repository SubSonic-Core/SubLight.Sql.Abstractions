**Copyright ¬© 2025 Kenneth Carter**

This project is licensed under a **dual-license** model:

### 1. **Educational / Non-Commercial Use (Free)**

You may use, copy, modify, and distribute this software **for educational, research, personal, or nonprofit projects**, provided that such use does **not directly or indirectly contribute to revenue generation**.

**Revenue Generation** includes, but is not limited to:

- Paid services or products  
- Grant-funded research  
- Fundraising activities  
- Inclusion in monetized platforms or consulting deliverables  
- Any deployment that results in financial benefit, even if the software itself is not sold  

If your use case touches revenue in any way, it is considered **commercial**.

### 2. **Commercial Use (Paid License)**

To use this software in a **commercial environment**, you must obtain a paid license from the copyright holder.

Licensing is **per application**, where an "application" is defined as any deployed software component that performs coordination using this DOC Library.

- Whether labeled as a service, backend, orchestration unit, or embedded module  
- Regardless of the number of instances, containers, or internal-only usage  
- Includes any system where coordination logic is expressed through this library's abstractions  

> **Note on Microservice Environments**  
> In distributed systems or microservice architectures, each deployed component that performs coordination using this DOC Library is considered a separate ‚Äúapplication‚Äù for licensing purposes.  
> This includes:  
> - Services that directly invoke coordination logic  
> - Embedded coordination modules within otherwise distinct services  
> - Any unit whose behavior depends on coordination abstractions provided by this library  
>   
> Centralized orchestration layers are licensed independently from downstream services, even if coordination is delegated.

> **Note on Hosted Services and Desktop Applications**  
> For hosted services‚Äîincluding load-balanced web servers, containerized deployments, and Kubernetes environments‚Äîthere is **no limit** on the number of instances per licensed application.  
> However, for desktop applications, licensing may be enforced on a **per-seat** basis, where each end-user installation requires a separate license.  
> Site licenses may be available for organizations seeking broader deployment terms.
